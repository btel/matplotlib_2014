{"name":"Maplotlib 2014","tagline":"","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nIn companies, institutes or at home we generate large amounts types of data. A success of our business or research may depend on a proper handling of the data. We can extract \r\nmeaningful patterns by applying data reduction and analysis techniques, but eventually we must present the data graphically. Many software packages allow to create a simple line plots or bar charts, but creating data-dense visualisations without distortions is still more of an art than science. The goal of the workshop is to arm you with practice-oriented tips that will help you to avoid clutter and increase the data density of your graphs.\r\n\r\nmatplotlib is a de facto standard in 2D plotting with Python in active development since 2003. The large number of [visualisation types](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is not matched by any other plotting library available for Python. It can be used to create interactive visualisations, hard copy plots or standalone applications.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will introduce the basic theory of data visualisation and put it in use through matplotlib. To unleash the full power of matplotlib, we will reach under the hood and discover some hidden gems in terms of customisation and working with visual primitives. The participants will be encouraged to practice their visualisations skills trough a series of examples. They will learn how to build complex data visualisations from ground up and spice them with a bit of interactivity. \r\n\r\n# Pre-eleminary schedule\r\n\r\n1) Introduction to matplotlib (30 min)\r\n- introduction to data visualisation\r\n- basic plotting\r\n- quick interactive data exploration\r\n\r\n2) Mapping data to graphical dimensions (60 min)\r\n- visual encoding channels\r\n- effective use of colour\r\n- data reduction methods\r\n- basic mapping using basemap (optional, +15 min)\r\n\r\n3) Creating visual style (45 min)\r\n- matplotlib data model\r\n- plot customisation\r\n- building complex plot layout\r\n- small multiplies\r\n\r\n4) Building interactive plots (30 min)\r\n- embedding in applications\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired software:\r\n- python 2.7 or 3.x\r\n- ipython (recommended)\r\n- matplotlib\r\n- basemap (optional)\r\n- numpy\r\n\r\nAll of the libraries are available in standard linux distributions, via pip or in scientific python distributions (such as [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/)).\r\n\r\n# About the trainer\r\n\r\nBartosz Telenczuk has been active Python user since 2005. He is creator of svgutils and he  has contributed to many open source Python libraries including numpy and matplotlib.  He is also a Python advocate and co-organiser of advanced Python schools for scientists. Currently he is a researcher in France, developing methods to interpret the electrical activity of the brain.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
